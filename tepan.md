# Frontier Toki Pona (ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ)

This document discourages from using ᴏʙꜱᴏʟᴇᴛᴇ rules, i.e. rules that would go unnecessarily beyond the scope of what is ᴘᴜ and ᴘᴏɴᴀ.

| (ᴘᴜ) sina pana e ona lon seme? ⇒  (ᴜɴ-ᴘᴜ) sina lon seme e ona? |
|:-|
| *Where did you put it?* |

This document treats some ᴘᴏɴᴀ rules as ᴏᴘᴛɪᴏɴᴀʟ stylistic advices, when they introduce additional grammatical concepts merely for the sake of a simpler style. For example, the distinction between [ɴᴏᴜɴ-ᴘʜʀᴀꜱᴇ](#noun)s and [ɴᴏᴜɴ-ɢʀᴏᴜᴘ](#noun)s only serves the purpose of motivating the ᴘᴏɴᴀ rule that [ɴᴏᴜɴ-ᴘʜʀᴀꜱᴇ](#noun)s can't contain more than one ["pi"](#genitive). In case of doubt: be ᴘᴏɴᴀ!

| (ᴛᴇᴘᴀɴ) nimi pi jan pona, pi toki pona ⇒ (ᴘᴏɴᴀ) nimi ni pi jan pona li lon toki pona: ona |
